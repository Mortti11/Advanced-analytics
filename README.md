# HR Employee Attrition Prediction

This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning models. By analyzing HR data, the project identifies key factors contributing to employee turnover and provides insights to help organizations retain talent.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the HR dataset used for analysis and modeling.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.
- **`src/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **`reports/`**: Contains the generated analysis reports and visualizations.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Sweetviz.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques applied to transform raw data into features suitable for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models, including XGBoost and other algorithms, to predict attrition.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, sweetviz, dtale, scikit-learn, xgboost

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mortti11/Advanced-analytics.git
   ```
2. **Install the necessary Python packages**:
   You can manually install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly sweetviz dtale scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and run the analysis.
2. Use the Python scripts in the `src/` directory for specific tasks like data preprocessing or model training.
3. Generated reports and visualizations can be found in the `reports/` directory.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional machine learning models for comparison.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Extend the analysis to include more advanced metrics.
